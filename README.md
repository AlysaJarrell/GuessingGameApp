# Overview

This is a simple app to demonstrate my learning with android studio to developing a mobile app.


This is a simple number guessing game. A random number between 1 and 100 is chosen, then the user types in a guess and selects the checkmark.
The app gives feedback on whether the randomized number is higher or lower than the guessed number and the user can make another guess.
The user can also select a button on the left to reset or replay the game.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to edit code and to use the android emulator to use and test the app.

I wrote the mobile app in Kotlin.

# Future Work

* I would like to add a start-up screen that lets you pick different difficulties.
These would mostly change the range of numbers that the random number could be pulled from. 
(Easy: 1 to 100, Medium: 1 to 1000, Hard: -1000 to 1000) 
* I would also like to work more on the overall presentation of the app. Add some more color, and unique fonts to the text.
* I need to fix/test for more exceptions in the code for various inputs to make sure it doesn't break. 
I need to make sure that the only input is actually a number (no letters or special characters).
